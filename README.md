# CRISPR-Array-Generator
This is a CRISPR array design and verification python package that will input gRNAs or DNA sequences of interest and output ready-to-order CRISPR Cas12 gRNA array oligonucleotides. This tool will be able to generate CRISPR array components with up to 9 gRNAs, and can also be used to check existing gRNAs and oligonucleotides for common errors.
